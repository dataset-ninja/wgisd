**Embrapa WGISD: Embrapa Wine Grape Instance Segmentation Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 300 images with 6451 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *uva_bbox* and *uva*.

Images in the WGISD dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (242 images) and *test* (58 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 5 variety: ***cabernet franc*** (65 images), ***chardonnay*** (65 images), ***sauvignon blanc*** (65 images), ***cabernet sauvignon*** (57 images), and ***syrah*** (48 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Embrapa Agricultural Informatics, Brazil</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Institute of Computing, University of Campinas, Brazil</span>.
